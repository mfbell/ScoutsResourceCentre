Aspiration
======

The project's aim is to make find, sharing and creating resource for Scouting easier. Originally for risk assessment, the uses broadened.

Design
------
Simplicity, clean and modern design, probably following material design principles.

Collaboration
------
The original concept was a centralised place for people, namely Scout Leadership, to share and find reusable resources like risk assessments to ease activity planning.

The aim now is a collaborative place where users can create, edit, contribute, and share activity, meeting, camp plans, risk assessments.

#### Online Scout Manager

Currently (late 2017) as far as I known OSM has a limited implementation of activity plan sharing. They may change with the 2018 update and TSA partnering with them.

Machine Learning
------
I want to incorporate machine learning into the project. Uses for this could be:
- Suggesting resources to users bases on previous views, eta.
- The search system
- Risk assessment suggestion for activities, eta.
- Resource improvement and duplicate merging.

Integration and Sharing
------
A long term goal could be to integrate with Online Scout Manager in a way. Whether that be our resource be attached to your troop's register and badge requirements sync or more. ~~*Supersede anyone?*~~

Each resource will get it own shortened URL automatically. E.g. `ab.cd/3aj4eq`

Integrated social media and email sharing.

Curated Resources
------
These will be quality, reviewed resources, which are more likely to be suggested to people to use. Different page design: e.g. large background image. AI could also help create them potentially.

**Community Approved** is an other idea to consider.

Resource Search System
